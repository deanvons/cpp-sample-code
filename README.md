# C++ Sample Code Repository

This repository contains example programs, exercises, and task solutions for the **C++ Bootcamp Modlue**.  
It is designed as a companion resource for students to explore, experiment, and learn fundamental C++ concepts through hands-on coding.

## üìÇ Repository Structure

The code is organized into topic-based folders. Each folder typically contains:
- **Demo scripts** ‚Äî to illustrate core concepts
- **Exercises/Tasks** ‚Äî for practice
- **Solutions** ‚Äî reference implementations

### Example Lesson Folder

| Folder | Description |
| ------ | ----------- |
| `intro-to-c/` | A gentle introduction to C syntax and concepts that carry over to C++, including arrays, basic I/O, constants, global variables, primitive types, and more. |
| `BasicIO/` | Examples of input/output using `cin`, `cout`, and formatting options. |
| `Comments/` | Proper use of single-line (`//`) and multi-line (`/* */`) comments. |
| `Constants/` | Declaring constants using `const` and `constexpr`. |
| `GlobalVariables/` | Scope and lifetime of global variables. |
| `InitializingVariables/` | Initialization styles: copy, direct, and uniform initialization. |
| `PrimitiveTypes/` | Overview of C++ primitive data types. |
| `SizeofOperator/` | Examples of using `sizeof` to determine memory usage. |
| `TaskSolutions/` | Completed solutions for coding challenges. |
| `Vectors/` | Working with dynamic arrays using `std::vector`. |
| `StringsAndFunctions/` | String manipulation and function usage. |
| `operations-and-operators/` | Arithmetic, relational, logical, and bitwise operator examples. |

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- **C++ Compiler**: GCC, Clang, or MSVC  
- **Minimum C++ Standard**: C++11 (unless otherwise stated)
- **Optional**: CMake for structured builds

### Running the Code
You can compile and run any example with:
```bash
g++ filename.cpp -o output
./output
```
Or, with CMake:
```bash
mkdir build && cd build
cmake ..
make
./<program_name>
```


## üìù Notes
- Code examples are meant for educational purposes and focus on clarity over optimization.
- Folder names match the topic progression in the course.
- You are encouraged to modify and experiment with the code to deepen your understanding.
